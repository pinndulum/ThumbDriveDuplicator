# Thumb Drive Duplicator
Duplicate files to multiple thumb drives at once. Select a directory path and insert a USB device then all files and folders in that directory are copied to the device.

Optional support to format each drive before the copy process starts. Check "Format Drive" and choose an available file system format. Optionally supply a device volume name that is applied at the time of formatting.

Progress is displayed for each device by drive letter. However it may become confusing to identify the physical device and match it with its progress.

Disconnect the device when it has finished copying, and insert another.
